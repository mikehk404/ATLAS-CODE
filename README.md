## 📖 Project Overview

**ATLAS_ASCEND 1.2** is a comprehensive disaster monitoring ecosystem designed for infrastructure-denied regions. It integrates a distributed **Ground Sensor Network (GSN)** with a **CubeSat Relay Node** and an **AI-driven Ground Station** to provide resilient early warnings for landslides, floods, and forest fires.

The system moves beyond traditional "Threshold-based" monitoring by implementing **"Proactive Detection"** philosophy, utilizing **Rate-of-Change (RoC)** algorithms at the edge and **Machine Learning** at the core.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The ecosystem is defined by three synchronized operational layers:

### 1. 🌍 GROUND SEGMENT (The "Fab Four" Sensor Nodes)
Distributed autonomous nodes deployed in high-risk zones (mountains, riverbanks).
* **MCU:** ESP32-WROOM-32 (Optimized for Deep Sleep).
* **Sensor Stack ("The Fab Four"):**
    1.  **Soil:** Capacitive Moisture Sensor (Landslide/Flood Saturation).
    2.  **Kinematics:** MPU-6050 6-DOF IMU (Seismic Activity/Slope Stability).
    3.  **Climate:** BME280 (Temp/Hum/Pressure for Fire & Storm Prediction).
    4.  **Geolocation:** NEO-M8N GNSS (Precise Hazard Mapping).
* **Edge Logic:** Performs **Rate-of-Change (RoC)** analysis to detect rapid environmental shifts (e.g., Flash Floods) before critical thresholds are reached.

### 2. 🛰️ SPACE SEGMENT (1U CubeSat Relay)
A 1U Satellite acting as a Data Relay and Optical Verification node.
* **Master Node (ESP32-S3):** Handles Navigation (GPS), Telemetry (LoRa), and Mission Control via **FreeRTOS**.
* **Slave Node (ESP32-CAM):** Dedicated to High-Resolution Imaging and buffering via a custom **Binary Chunking Protocol**.

### 3. 🖥️ PROCESSING SEGMENT (Predictive Analytics Engine)

The Ground Station functions as the ecosystem's **Central Intelligence Core**, designed to transition disaster management from *reactive monitoring* to *proactive forecasting*. It performs **Multi-Modal Data Fusion**, aggregating real-time telemetry from the Ground Mesh Network with satellite imagery baselines.

#### A. Core Architecture: Sensor Fusion & Machine Learning 🧠
The system utilizes a **Random Forest Regressor** (via `scikit-learn`) to model non-linear environmental correlations, generating a precise **Disaster Probability Score ($0-100\%$)**.

| Input Source | Data Type | Function in Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ground Nodes** | *Dynamic* | Real-time monitoring of **Soil Moisture**, **Seismic Vibration ($G$)**, and **Pressure Trends ($\Delta P$)**. |
| **Satellite** | *Static* | **NDVI (Vegetation Index)** establishes a baseline risk. *Logic: Low NDVI (Deforestation) = High Soil Instability Factor.* |

#### B. Temporal Analytics: "Rate-of-Change" (RoC) Logic 📉
Instead of relying solely on static thresholds, the engine analyzes **Time-Series Data** to detect rapid anomalies:
* **Derivative Analysis ($d/dt$):** Calculates the velocity of sensor changes. A moisture spike of **$>10\%$ in 5 mins** triggers a "Flash Flood" alert even if absolute saturation is below critical limits.
* **Noise Filtration:** Implements statistical averaging algorithms to reject sensor jitter and false positives.

#### C. Geospatial Intelligence (GIS Dashboard) 🗺️
The Python engine (utilizing `Matplotlib` & `Cartopy`) transforms raw telemetry into actionable decision support layers:
* **Dynamic Risk Polygons:** Applies **Convex Hull** algorithms to delineate high-risk clusters dynamically.
* **Wildfire Heatmaps:** Generates interpolated risk layers based on Temperature/Humidity anomalies and Fire Weather Index (FWI).
* **Predictive Forecasting:** Plots 7-day trend projections by comparing Historical Actuals vs. AI-Predicted models.

## 🚀 Key Engineering Innovations

### A. "Rate-of-Change" (RoC) Trigger
Unlike passive loggers that only alarm at static thresholds (e.g., >90% moisture), ATLAS nodes calculate the **first derivative (velocity)** of sensor data.
* *Scenario:* If soil moisture spikes **>10% in 5 minutes**, the system triggers a **"Flash Flood Alert"** immediately, even if the absolute value is only 50%.

### B. Master-Slave Satellite Core
To prevent the satellite from "freezing" during image processing, we utilize a dual-core distributed architecture:
* **Core 0 (Master):** Handles Telemetry & Navigation (High Priority).
* **Core 1 (Slave):** Handles Image Compression & Fragmentation (Low Priority).

### C. Adaptive Power Management
* **Normal Mode:** Deep Sleep for 5 minutes (<20µA).
* **Urgent Mode:** Deep Sleep for 1 minute (Active Monitoring) upon detecting RoC anomalies.

### D. Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion (Ground + Space)
The system bridges the gap between IoT and Remote Sensing by fusing **Dynamic Telemetry** (Ground Nodes) with **Static Satellite Baselines** (NDVI).
* *Innovation:* The AI assigns a "Vulnerability Weight" based on vegetation health. An area with **Low NDVI (Deforestation)** will trigger a Landslide Alert at a lower soil moisture threshold compared to a dense forest, significantly reducing false negatives.

### E. Predictive GIS & Temporal Forecasting (AI-Driven) 📉
Moving beyond reactive alerts, the Ground Station functions as a **"Time Machine"** for disaster management:
* **Short-Term (Tactical):** Extrapolates Barometric Pressure trends ($\Delta P$) to predict storm surges **12 hours in advance**.
* **Long-Term (Strategic):** Utilizes **Linear Regression** on 30-day historical data to project disaster risk trends for the **next 7 days**, enabling authorities to allocate resources (food, medicine) *before* the crisis peaks.
* **Visualization:** Uses **Convex Hull algorithms** to dynamically delineate high-risk zones on the map.
